Proj2

Files that should exist in directory
	Makefile
	main.c
	This README file
	.git directory with log of commits

Getting Started
	to run the make command, type "make proj2" This will run the compile commands on the main.c file.
	Next, to run the program, type "./proj2"

What it does
	While this program is being submitted unfinished, I feel like my main.c file at least has the decent pieces crucial to this project; save for the logs and critical section pieces.
	Most of this program has the building blocks figured out for spreading the program into producer and consumer files/execs and using shared memory

Main issues:
	Still had trouble getting fork() to work correctly (hopefully resolved, or at least partially)
	Sank a lot of time into getting the beginnings of signal handling(again, partially resolved)
	Sank a lot of hours into working through learning shared memory functions and workings, ended up with a few orphaned/unremovable entries in ipcs. Thankfully they're somewhat small and hopefully will be cleaned out before this project is graded!

Unimplemented parts of this project:
	Logs
	Critical section
